title: About Me

Hi my name is Dylan and this is my blog for digital humanities class at CNU.  Let’s start by saying i’m a computer science major so my writing skills aren’t the best.  I’m hoping this class will help me get better at writing as well as filling the writing intensive requirement so i can graduate next semester.  Speaking of graduation, I want to be a software engineer/programmer after I graduate.  I’ve had 2 internships over the past 3 summers and both of them have been doing dev-ops work.  While those were good experiences it's not something I would like to do.  I’m also an introvert so I try to not interact much and try to get my thoughts across as quick as possible.

Some personal achievements of mine are getting Eagle Scout and 2 palms, getting into college and getting the triple crown.  The triple crown is an award in boy scouts for doing all 3 (now 4 for a grand slam) high adventure bases.  I did it in 2 year with the first being sailing in the [Florida Keys](https://www.bsaseabase.org/) and the next two within two days of each other.  Hiking in the wilderness for 14 days in [New Mexico](https://www.philmontscoutranch.org/) then canoeing in the boundary waters of canada new [Ely Minnesota](https://www.ntier.org/). (link to all three high adventure bases)  

Since I’m a computer science major I like to code, but what else do I like to do in my free time/for fun.  I enjoy building computers and just learning about new and different parts that can go into one.  Gaming related, I have around 6k hours played in a game called [Path of Exile](https://www.pathofexile.com/).  I started playing in 2013 but really got into around 2016/17.  It's a great game and if you are into ARPG or if you liked diablo 2 you should try it.  I used to play Overwatch and TF2 a while back but haven’t touched either of them in about a year.  I know this was short, but I hope you got a rough idea of what i'm like as a person.
