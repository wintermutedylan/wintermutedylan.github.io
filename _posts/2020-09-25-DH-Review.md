Project: Ancient World Mapping Center

Project Director: Lindsay Holman

Project URL: http://awmc.unc.edu/wordpress

My project that i’ll be reviewing is the Ancient World Mapping Center.  It is a research center at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.  It is also funded and supported by the department of history at the university.   The Center wants the field of ancient studies to do more with cartography and historical geography.  It does this by providing research and teaching resources for people to get involved.  They welcome anyone who is interested in cartography or geography related to ancient studies to use all their resources.  They are continuing the work of the Classical Atlas Project but also working on their own research projects. 

 Most of the maps that are available you can download from the website.  The maps can be downloaded as a PDF or viewed directly in the browser.  Metadata can be accessed for each map by clicking on the metadata link above each map.  There is also an API you can use to browse and interact with the database.  To find a map you're looking for you either need to search for it using their tool or know the AWMC ID for that specific map.  Each map has a download for their GeoJSON and RDF files.  These files have all the geometry for the area that they cover so you can implement them into your own maps.  
 
 This tool can be used to map out places that could have more historical artifacts and to help create a catalog of ancient civilizations. You can commission AWMC to create an original map for the content that you are working on.  By offering this service, it enables more research projects in ancient civilizations and helps people get into them too.  Whether its research for the university of north carolina at chapel hill or any other university the center is open to all commissions.  
 
This project is really cool becuase i’m fascinated with ancient history, especially ancient greece.  I love playing games that take place in historical places like Assassin’s Creed Odyssey which takes place in ancient greece.  The game has a  accurate map of ancient Greece (as accurate as you can get in a game) and it's quite fun to explore it.  This is possible because of sites and resources like this center that provide maps of ancient civilizations like greece.  I spent a decent amount of time looking through all the free maps they have on the site.
 
 I did however have trouble navigating the site.  It took me a while to find the database of all the maps.  The free map tab they have is just a few of the maps. While there are a decent amount of maps in there inorder to get all the information of each map you have to go to the API documentation.  In the API tool they provide you have to know what map you want and the ID that is associated with the map.  Other than those issues I thought everything was well labeled and I could navigate the site to find what I was looking for.
