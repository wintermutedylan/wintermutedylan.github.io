  Mapping the Fablehaven series. Mainly focusing on the primary nature reserve of Fablehaven.  Nature preserves house fantasy creatures like fairies, centaurs, satyrs and the like.  There are many different reserves around the world and 2 of them are located in the United states.  Like states about these house mythical creatures but Fablehaven is special because it's a secret reserve.  There are 5 secret reserves housing very special creatures.  I'll be mapping this reserve as it's the main setting for most of the books.  In the books they have a lot of details about where everything is.  The author is very descriptive about where the main characters walk to and how far away they are from the main house which is near the center of the reserve.  There is also not a really well documented map of the reserve if any online that I can find.  
  
    I would like for there to be one so new readers of the book can see where everything is.  This map will be an interactive map.  In the sense that if you want to know where the centaurs lived then you can click a checkbox and it will highlight them.  Also if you want more information about them you can click on the picture of the centaur and learn more about them.  Like what they looked like, or what they ate and any other information that is presented in the book or the caretaker's guide to fablehaven.  This is a book that the author made with a lot of information about all the creatures in the reserve.

  Another feature of the map and database is that there will be a timeline that lists out all the events that take place.  Each event will have its own page that you can click on to get more information about it.  Like where it took place, when, who was there, and the after effects.  From this timeline if you want to know more about where an event took place you can click on the location where it happened.  If this location is inside the reserve of Fablehaven then the map will be pulled up with the location marked.  
  
  For the program that I will be using to map everything, I will use some sort of fantasy mapping one.  There are multiple out there that are used for mapping dungeons and dragons campaign maps.  It is very likely that i'll use one of those and have it embedded on a website like a wiki of some sort.  Some of the programs that are out there are Project Deios, Inkarnate, Wonderdraft, Flowscape, and Campaign Cartographer 3.  I will be using one of these programs to make the map, then the map will be posted on a website of some sort.  Either a wiki like fandom or iâ€™ll host my own website on aws or some web hosting service.
