title: TEI Coding
---

I didn't really have any problems with coding the TEI.  It didnt' take me that long to code it, maybe around 5 minutes or so.  Since i'm a computer science major I already know how to code so this was really easy for me.  Everything made sense to me from how you explained it.  The only thing that I had to look up was how to do the m dash thing in TEI.  Once I found the list of all the tags you wanted us to use I had no problems.  My section didn't have much to do for the side of special tags.  All I used was the paragraph tag and 2 m dashes.  there was a quote but it was just an open quote with no close.

TEI is a really easy mark up language to use.  I feel like HTML is used to communicate with CSS and javascript but TEI is just really for mark up and this kind of stuff. Each tag is really self explanitory.  All you need to do is had the documentation up on the side to look up what they are.  Also having an open and close for each tag helps with organization of each paragraph and quote.  I know this is short but I honestly don't know what to write since this was so easy for me.  I didn't have any problems with coding and didn't need any help with the code either.  The passage I had didn't have any complex tags or really any quotes.  just 2 m dashes and multiple paragraphs.
