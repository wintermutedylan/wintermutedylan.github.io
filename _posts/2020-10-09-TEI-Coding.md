I didn't really have any problems with coding the TEI.  It didnt' take me that long to code it, maybe around 5 minutes or so.  Since i'm a computer science major I already know how to code so this was really easy for me.  Everything made sense to me from how you explained it.  The only thing that I had to look up was how to do the m dash thing in TEI.  Once I found the list of all the tags you wanted us to use I had no problems.  My section didn't have much to do for the side of special tags.  All I used was the paragraph tag and 2 m dashes.  there was a quote but it was just an open quote with no close.
